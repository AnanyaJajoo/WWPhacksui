                Throughout the world, many schools are going virtual. Teachers use various platforms such as Zoom, Google meet, etc. The classroom setting has changed drastically and now many classrooms and schools are prone to 
                cyber attacks and unwanted members accessing their zoom calls. This creates a very unsade enviroment for teachrs and students. That's why ZOOM GO helps create top notch security by using machine learning and face regonition to scan the students face to see if they match theur ID
                picture. If they do they will be directly linked to the zoom call and and unwanted memeber will not have access to their zoom calls.
